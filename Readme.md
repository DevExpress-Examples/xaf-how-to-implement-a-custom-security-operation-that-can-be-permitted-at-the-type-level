<p>In the XAF Security System, the following operations can be permitted for a specific type by default: <em>Read</em>, <em>Write</em>, <em>Create</em>, <em>Delete </em>and <em>Navigate</em>. In this topic, an implementation of the additional <em>Export </em>operation is shown. The customization of the <strong>ExportController </strong>which should consider whether or not the <em>Export </em>operation is allowed for the currently displayed object type is also demonstrated.</p>
